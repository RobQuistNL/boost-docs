# Retrieving data from Filecoin

Storage Providers on Filecoin support various modes of retrievals for deal data that they have accepted from clients.

Reputation systems periodically crawl the network and record success rate for Storage Providers and determine whether they should make future FIL+ deals with them depending on how well they serve retrievals.
