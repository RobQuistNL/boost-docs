# How to migrate from Boost v1 to Boost v2

## Introduction

Boost v2 introduces the Local Index Directory as a replacement for the DAG store. It scales horizontally and provides a more intuitive experience for users, by surfacing problems in the UI and providing repair functionality.

## Instructions

### Install YugabyteDB database

The Local Index Directory stores retrieval indexes in a YugabyteDB database.

We recommend running YugabyteDB on a dedicated machine with SSD drives. The indexes require up to 2% of the size of the data, eg 20 GiB index for 1 TiB of raw data. Review the size of your existing DAG store and account for similar disk requirements.

### Migrate DAG store to Local Index Directory

**1. Clone the Boost repository to a temporary directory**

Note: Donâ€™t overwrite your existing boost instance at this stage

```
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:filecoin-project/boost.git boostv2
cd boostv2
```

**2. Check out the Boost v2 branch**

```
git checkout release/v2
```

**3. Build from source**

```
make
```

**4. Migrate dagstore indices**

Depending on the amount of data your SP is storing, this step could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. You can run it even while Boost v1 continues to run. The command can be stopped and restarted. It will continue from where it left off.

```
./migrate-lid yugabyte dagstore --help
```

Run the migration with parameters to connect to YugabyteDB on its Cassandra and PostgreSQL interfaces:

```
./migrate-lid yugabyte \
  --hosts 127.0.0.1 \
  --connect-string="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433" \
  dagstore
```

It will output a progress bar, and also a log file with detailed migration information at `migrate-yugabyte.log`

**5. Run the `boostd-data` service**

`boostd-data` is a data proxy service which abstracts the access to LID through an established interface. It makes it easier to secure the underlying database and not expose it. `boostd-data` listens to a websocket interface, which is the entrypoint which should be exposed to `boostd`, and`booster-http`

Start the `boostd-data` service with parameters to connect to YugabyteDB on its Cassandra and PostgreSQL interfaces:

```
./boostd-data run yugabyte \
  --hosts 127.0.0.1 \
  --connect-string="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433" \
  --addr 0.0.0.0:8044
```

**6. Update `boostd` repository config**

Add the `boostd-data` service config to `<boost repo>/config.toml`. Note that the connection must be configured to go over a websocket, and the host and port must point to the `boostd-data` service.

For example:

```
[LocalIndexDirectory]
  ServiceApiInfo = "ws://1.2.3.4:8044"
```

**7. Install Boost v2**

```
make install
```

Note that in v2 `booster-http` and `booster-bitswap` take slightly different parameters (see below).

**8. Stop `boostd`, `booster-http` and `booster-bitswap`**

You need to stop `boostd` before migrating `piece info` data.

**9. Migrate piece info data (information about which sector each deal is stored in)**

This should take no more than a few minutes.

```
./migrate-lid yugabyte \
  --hosts 127.0.0.1 \
  --connect-string="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433" \
  pieceinfo
```

**10. Start the upgraded versions of `boostd`, `booster-http` and `booster-bitswap`**

Note that `booster-http` and `booster-bitswap` take slightly different parameters:

* `--api-boost` is removed
* There is a new parameter `--api-lid` that points to the LID service, e.g. `--api-lid="ws://1.2.3.4:8044"`
