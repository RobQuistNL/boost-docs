# What is Boost?

Boost is a tool for Storage Providers to manage data storage and retrievals on filecoin. It replaces the go-fil-markets package in lotus with a standalone binary that runs alongside a lotus daemon and lotus miner. Boost exposes libp2p interfaces for making storage and retrieval deals, a web interface for managing storage deals, and a graphql interface for accessing and updating real time deal information.
