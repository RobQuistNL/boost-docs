# Upgrade from Lotus to Boost

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are running a `monolith` `lotus-miner`and have not yet split the `markets` service into an individual process, refer to the [Lotus documentation](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/configure/split-markets-miners/) and first do that, before upgrading to Boost.
