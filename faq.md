Q: Is Boost compatible with the Lotus client? Can a client use `lotus client deal` to send a deal to Boost storage providers or do they have to use the boost client?\
A: Yes, boost should work with any client given it supports the storage market protocol / default standard of Filecoin network today.

Q: Does Boost provide retrieval functionality or a client still need to use the Lotus client for retrievals?\
A: Boost doesn't change anything about retrieval so far. We are working on new retrieval options.
